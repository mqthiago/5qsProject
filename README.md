# 5QS Project Questionnaire
The 5QS Project Questionnaire is a simple web application that allows users to answer a series of questions and save their responses for later use. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it uses local storage or Node.js to save user data.

Getting Started
To use the 5QS Project Questionnaire, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. Click the "Iniciar Projeto 5QS" button to begin answering the questionnaire. Once you have answered all of the questions, click the "Salvar Respostas" button to save your responses.

Methodology
The 5QS methodology consists of five key questions that must be answered in order to solve a problem. These questions are:

What are the input data required?
What should I do with these data?
What are the constraints of this problem?
What is the expected result?
What is the sequence of steps to reach the expected result (final algorithm)?
